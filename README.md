Penny
=====

<p>Penny is a MVC (Model view controller) and is made by Anna Dahlgren. You are free to use it!</p>

Installation
============
<p>First, you need to clone all the codes to your local machine.</p>
Open git bash or someting similar and type the following code when you are ready to clone:
<code>git clone https://github.com/annaapelsin/Penny.git</code>

You also need to do the site/data directory writable, but if you want to wait a little bit, it's all OK!
You can do this step later on when you install Penny. 
<code>cd Penny</code> 
<code>chmod 777 site/data</code>
